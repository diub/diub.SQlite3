# diub.SQlite3

usage see: https://kodierecke.diub.de/de/csharp/diub//sqlite3.html#LSQLITE3

A simple wrapper class for direct use of SQLite (sqlite3.dll).

The implementation is not a universal interface! Only the basic functionalities are spread, but these in a convenient way.

All fields, which should be stored in the table, must be public!
